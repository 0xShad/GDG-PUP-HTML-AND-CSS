      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Shadrack V. Castro</strong>, A 2nd year BSIT Student
        at <em>Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Quezon City</em>. I
        started <strong>coding</strong> during the pandemic and fell in-love
        with it eventually. I enjoy <strong>Web Development</strong> but hates
        learning a new technologies 😂. I have no choice anyways. I’ve had the
        opportunity to try different aspects of technology,
        <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>game development</strong> and
        <strong>mobile app development</strong>. But yeah, bumabalik padin
        talaga sa'yo web development. Aside from coding websites, i also enjoy
        making mobile app using <strong>Flutterflow!</strong>. That's all.
      </p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from sitting infront of a computer, building all kinds of features
        of a website. I also love to travel with my motorcycle🏍️💨. I also enjoy
        doing workouts, not quite consistent though.
